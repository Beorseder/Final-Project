                    <h1>How to Pass the AP Exam: </h1>
                    <p>
                        To ensure that you get that 5 on the AP exam, we want to provide you with all of the best strategies to apply during the test and tips beforehand.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tips: </h2>
                    <ul class="whatToKnow">
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Drink lots of water when studying, before the exam, and during the break.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Study Early for the Exam - Try to review the information every few days, starting a couple months before the exam.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Make a studying schedule, especially if you have many AP exams, so that you don't forget one of them.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Emulate a realistic testing environment when practicing, so that you're used to what the exam will feel like.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Make sure to completely understand something, don't just move on if you're unsure about what something means or how it works.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use AP practice questions from the exam, so that you know what to expect.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Strategies: </h2>
                    <ul class="whatToKnow">
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do the easy questions first, then come back to the harder ones. The questions are worth the same amount of points, so answer wisely.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Eliminate answers you know aren't correct. If you have to guess on a question, at least don't guess one of the answers that you know is wrong, make your odds better.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bring food and water for the break, so that you have lots of energy for the second portion of the exam.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Make sure to keep track of the time you have, so that if there's a question you know will take a long time, you can skip it.</p></li>
