                        Big Idea Four covers rates of chemical reactions and how to determine them.

                    <h2>Important Things to Know: </h2>
                    <ul class="whatToKnow">
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What the definition of rate is and what the rate expression is for any given reactant or product.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How to determine if a rate is affected by concentration, of the effect of it in such a situation.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How temperature affects the rate constant and the consequent rate.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How a catalyst can affect the rate and how surface area can affect the rate.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What collision theory is and how orientation and energy of the colliding atoms/molecules affect them.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What the relationship between change in time, change is entropy, and change in enthalpy is.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What the order of a reaction is and what the significance of a reaction's order is.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How to determine orders of individual reactants and the overall equation, as well as how knowing these individual orders can affect the rate of the reaction.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How to determine the order of a reaction based off of different graphs.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How to determine the amount of time that has passed in a zero, first, or second order reaction through initial and final concentrations, or to get concentrations.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How to determine the rate constand and what the significance of its units are with a different order reaction.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What a reactant is, what a product is, what a catalyst is, and what a reaction intermediate is.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How to know if a mechanism is consistent / how to determine the slow step in a mechanism using the rate law.</p></li>
